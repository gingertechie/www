It’s that time o’ year again when the world goes mad for all things Irish. So in an absolutely shameless attempt to jump on the bandwagon, here’s your super St Patrick’s Day Fintech Map O’ Ireland!

![](./1*dteS2iT80KWySWtZTr6opQ@2x.jpeg)

In the three months since the v0.7 edition of the map there have been quite a number of changes. So many changes – and some significant news about the underlying data – that I’ve bumped the version up to v1.0

### The Map is Complete!

Well, no. I still have fifty companies either waiting to be verified and added to the map. It’s a manual and time-intensive process, though thankfully the [CRO now have an API](https://services.cro.ie/overview.aspx), which is pretty handy. Sadly, almost half of these companies haven’t responded to requests for information, so they sit in limbo …

### Kiss Me I’m Irish Fintech

Lots of new companies have made it onto the map. That’s not to say they’re new companies – many are very well established. Also, lots of other companies didn’t make it, and here’s why:

* Their company was originally founded outside Ireland or Northern Ireland. The map doesn’t care if you’re third generation County Dublin or lived your whole life in sunny Antrim – them’s the rules. And I’m not repealing them – unlike the 8th amendment which is clearly bonkers and should be repealed immediately [#RepealThe8th](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23repealthe8th&src=tyah)
* Their product is used by financial companies but isn’t specifically a financial product. The lines are becoming increasingly blurred here.
* There’s no tech. It’s called FinTECH. G’wan now ya consultants ya!
* They’re pre-launch or private beta. I'm keeping an eye out for you Deposify!
