Also, I’ve had a number of enquiries about using the map. Back in Version 0.5 I clarified use under the Creative Commons “[Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)” license. This means:

I should also thank all of you who have asked for usage clarification — I’m always very happy to support sharing amongst the Fintech community.

Now, if your seat is in the upright position, your seatbelt fastened and your tray-table is safely stowed, here’s Version 0.6 of Ireland’s Fintech map.

As always you can find the latest map at <https://gingertechie.com/map> and you can reach me at dave@gingertechie.com
