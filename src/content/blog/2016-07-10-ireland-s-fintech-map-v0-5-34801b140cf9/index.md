Firstly, I’ve added a permanent link to the map at [gingertechie.com/map](https://www.gingertechie.com/map) so you’ll always be able to find the latest greatest update.

Secondly, I’ve added a Creative Commons license to the map to clarify how you can use it. The license is Creative Commons “**Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International**”, which means you’re free to use and distribute it under the following conditions:

* **Attribution** — You must give [**appropriate credit**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), provide a link to the license, and [**indicate if changes were made**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
* **NonCommercial** — You may not use the material for [**commercial purposes**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).
* **NoDerivatives** — If you [**remix, transform, or build upon**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) the material, you may not distribute the modified material.

This means you may not slap your company logo on it and reuse it in presentations. You know who you are (*and so do I, by the way*). Shame on you.

OK here are the updates for this version:

* Coindrum — [coindrum.com](http://www.coundrum.com) in “Other”
* Escher Group — [eschergroup.com](https://www.eschergroup.com) in “Payments”
* FromMe2You — [me2you.ie](http://www.me2you.ie/) in “Payments”
* One4all — [one4all.ie](https://www.one4all.ie) in “Payments”
* Oxygen8 — [oxygen8.com](http://www.oxygen8.com) in “Payments”
* Relay Software — [relay.ie](http://www.relay.ie) in “Insurance”
* Wesavvy — [wesavvy.com](https://www.wesavvy.com) in “Insurance”

I’m very pleased that Wesavvy are the first startup that I was tracking who have transferred onto the main companies map. Well done Hesus & team!

I’ve also re-added Leveris and Sentenial, who I accidentally dropped out at v0.4 — sorry!

If you’re not on the map, you may be one of the 17 companies who I’m waiting for clarifications from. I’ve set specific criteria for inclusion in the map, because I believe it’s important that this information is reliable. Check your spam folders, folks. Or you may be one of the 28 companies on my todo list. In which case, sorry for the delay, there will be another version shortly.

As always, I’m very happy to take corrections, feedback, additions and comments. Drop me a line, tweet me, or comment here!

Oh, and here’s the map :)
