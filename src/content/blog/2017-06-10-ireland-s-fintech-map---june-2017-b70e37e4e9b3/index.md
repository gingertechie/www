Hello Fintech fans! It’s time for another update to the all-Ireland Fintech map.

Here’s a quick reminder of the criteria for being included:

* The company is founded in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland
* There is a product that is commercially available (products in closed-beta or private trials do not suffice)
* The product is “Fin” – is specific to financial services
* There is some “tech” – proprietary technology developed by the company

Some eagle-eyed readers have asked why banks aren’t included, as they meet the criteria. Good question. I guess that’s the difference between financial services and Fintech. And that difference, in my view, is attitude.

Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t about bashing banks. There are some really awesome changes happening behind the scenes in Irish banks, and other financial services companies too, for that matter. But if the sole purpose of a Fintech company is to improve the customer outcome through technology, I don’t think that the banks can be considered Fintech.

Yet.

### Updates

Again the eagle-eyed reader will notice that I released a version of the map in May but didn’t push this out. This was an update to correct a number of errors. Yes, even Fintech maps have bugs.

In this version we have some changes:

* [AssureHedge](http://www.assurehedge.com) move into FX (thanks to [Barry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barry-mccarthy-a355727) for pointing this out)
* [Corlytics](http://www.corlytics.com) are added to the Regulation section
* [Quaternion Risk Management](http://www.quaternion.com) added to the FinOps section
* [RapidRatings](http://www.rapidratings.com) also added to FinOps
* [ViClarity](http://www.viclarity.com) added to the Regulation section

I’ve also updated the logo for [Flender](http://www.flender.ie) (thanks [Oli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivercavanagh) for the heads-up) and for [LinkedFinance](http://www.linkedfinance.com).
