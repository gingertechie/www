It’s been a while since the last version of this map. One reason is that it’s very time-consuming to search, catalog and verify companies details. The good news is that you can be confident in this information\*. The other reason is that I’m doing some really fun work with [Ammeon](http://www.ammeon.com), a private cloud integrator, which hasn’t left much time for this!

Anyway, enough excuses.

The new additions to version 0.4 of the map are:

* Big Red Cloud — [www.bigredcloud.com](http://www.bigredcloud.com)
* Fintrax — [www.fintrax.com](http://www.fintrax.com)
* Global Risk Technologies — [www.globalrisktechnologies.com](http://www.globalrisktechnologies.com)
* PennyOwl — [www.pennyowl.com](http://www.pennyowl.com)
* Peracton — [www.peracton.com](http://www.peracton.com)
* Rockboro Analytics — [www.rcali.com](http://www.rcali.com)
* Thesaurus Payroll — [www.thesaurus.ie](http://www.thesaurus.ie)
* WorldNet — [www.worldnettps.com](http://www.worldnettps.com)
* Xcelerit — [www.xcelerit.com](http://www.xcelerit.com)

So here’s version 0.4 of the Irish Fintech Companies map.

As always, there are companies missing from this list. Maybe there are companies who shouldn’t be here? Or maybe you’d like to use this in your publication? Get in touch: dave@*Ginger*Techie.com or on twitter at [@supergingerdave](https://www.twitter.com/supergingerdave)

\* Well, except for the fake company that I inserted. If you’re thinking of reusing this map commercially, you might want to remove that one :)
