You’ll spot a few companies that are based in Belfast. Yep, I’m including Belfast in the definition of Irish Fintech Companies.

Thanks to everyone who responded with comments, corrections and support. I have a backlog of a dozen companies to be reviewed and added, so sorry if you didn’t make it on this version — you’ll be on the next one!

At this stage I trust everyone is shown on the ecosystem map, but if you spot an omission (or someone who oughtn’t be there), please do let me know.

Enjoy the easter eggs!
