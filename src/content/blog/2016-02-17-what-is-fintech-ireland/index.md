But first, I’m going to tell you what companies I consider to be part of Fintech Ireland. And to do that, let’s agree on what companies are NOT Fintech Ireland.

Your company isn’t Fintech Ireland if it’s:

* A company founded outside of Ireland, even if they have an office in Ireland or the founders are born and raised in Ireland. Sorry [Stripe](https://twitter.com/stripe).
* A company that services several industries or sectors, even if Financial Services is part of your market. Sorry [Intercom](https://medium.com/u/7ca8972daf76).
* A company that is “Coming Soon”, in “beta” – or is no longer operating. Sorry Anglo Irish Bank.
* A company that provides consulting, managed services or people-based solutions – even if they use Excel – it’s not Fintech. Sorry [Accenture Tech Labs](https://medium.com/u/727137ab2916).

Still with me? Good. OK, I know this a pretty thin definition, and Fintech Ireland could include lots more. What about the rest of the ecosystem?

* Global companies who operate in Ireland
* Consulting and Service companies
* Software as a Service Providers
* Venture Capital and other sources of Fintech funding
* Accelerators, Incubators and other support programmes
* Mentors, industry experts and analysts
* FPAI. IFS2020. BPFI. NPP. WTF?
* Banks. Remember them? They haven’t gone away you know

I said I would tell you what “Fintech Ireland” means. To do this means looking beyond a simple list of companies and exploring the ecosystem. So I’ll do that – but not in this post. For now, you’re going to have to make do with a list of Fintech Ireland companies.

Who’s missing? Who should be removed? Who’s in the wrong category? Don’t agree with these categories? Tweet me at [@supergingerdave](https://twitter.com/supergingerdave) and let’s make version 0.2 even better.
