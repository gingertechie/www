I’m special. At least that’s what my mother always told me. And you’re special too. We’re all unique special snowflakes. As a startup, you’re a tiny percent of the population, even more special and unique.

Except that you’re not.

### Get out of the Building

It’s sometimes difficult to see beyond our own challenges, our industry, our city and our national borders. But when you do, you might just find. others that are also unique, just like you.

The idea is that if you want to learn about your customers you’ve got to get out there and interact with them in the real world, not just the imagined facsimiles that we craft on our laptops.

So I figured, if I want to learn more about how Fintech works, I’d better get out of the building. In fact, I’d better get out of the city and off the island of Ireland. But where to?

### CphFTW

It wasn’t a difficult decision. One of the most ecologically progressive countries in the world, where cash is becoming a thing of the past, and a city where bikes outnumber cars. What’s not to like?

So I reached out to the Copenhagen Fintech group [CFIR.dk](http://www.cfir.dk) and the response was so friendly and fantastic, the decision was made.

### Fintech Styley

Fast forward to late summer. It was as I watched the royal band marching past the brass-plated CFIR building, I came to realise that I may have been tragically under-dressed for the meeting.

Well, it’s quite a nice area. As you would expect for the Danish bankers association. Note to Ireland’s Fintech groups: more marching bands (oh Belfast, not like *that).*

Luckily, I had recently ironed my limited-edition FintechIreland t-shirt. So when [Kim Vindberg-Larsen](http://www.cfir.dk/en-GB/AboutCFIR/Organisation/Pages/Secretariat.aspx) greeted me, impeccably attired in a full suit and tie, I was able to style it out.

That is, until what happened next …
