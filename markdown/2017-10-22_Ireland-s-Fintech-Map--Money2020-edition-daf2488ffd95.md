Eagle-eyed readers will have spotted that Insurance has switched places with Currency & FX. I’m certain there are many more InsureTech companies out there – let me know!

Here are the updates:

* [Cambrist](http://cambrist.com) – added to Currency & FX
* [ClaimVantage](http://claimvantage.com) – moved to Insurance
* [FundSME](http://www.fundsme.ie) – added to Credit/Lending
* [Grid Finance](http://grid.finance) – updated logo
* [InvoiceFair](http://www.invoicefair.com/) – moved to Credit/Lending
* [MoneyCube](https://moneycube.ie) – added to Saving & Investi
* [Taxhug](https://www.taxhug.com) – added to Accounting
* [TreasuryHQ](http://www.treasuryhq.com) – added to Platforms
* [Xcelerit](http://www.xcelerit.com) – moved to Regulation

I’m particularly delighted to add Cambrist and TreasuryHQ, who I’ve been tracking for a while. Up and to the right folks!!
