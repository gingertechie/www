The All-Ireland Fintech Map.

Can you believe it’s 20 months since I released the first version of the map, way back in February 2016.

Just a handful of changes this time:

* Elavon and Treasury HQ removed
* ID-Pal added – [id-pal.com](http://id-pal.com/)
* PaycheckPlus added – [paycheckplus.ie](https://www.paycheckplus.ie/)

Keep the suggestions coming! Here’s the latest map [v1.3](https://gingertechie.com/map)
