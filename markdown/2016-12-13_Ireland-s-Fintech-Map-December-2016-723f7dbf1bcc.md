### Ireland’s Fintech Map December 2016

Season’s Greetings, beautiful Fintech nerds!

Interestingly, there are now as many companies queued up for the map as are actually on the map. But because of the strict criteria for inclusion, not all companies end up on the map.

So what happens to these Companies? Do we simply grind them up into a fine dust, to be sprinkled on the lattés of sexy new Fintech Startups? For Legal Reasons, I am compelled to answer “No”.

### Ho Ho How The Map Works

Early in the life of the Fintech map I had to make a decision – which companies to include? I don’t have an infinite sheet of paper, nor an infinite amount of time. I’m not a government-led enterprise agency y'know.

So, in order for the map to work on a single A4 page, I had to define some criteria to decide who made it on the map, and who got a lump of coal in their sack. Or a term sheet from a local VC. 😎

I sense you have questions.

> Who gave me the right to set the criteria?

Nobody.

> Can the criteria be changed?

Sure.

> Will there be other maps with different criteria?

I refer you to the “infinite time” answer I gave previously.

### The Rules

When I first wrote the criteria, I wrote them in an overcomplicated negatively-phrased way. What else would you expect from a former software engineer? Here’s an attempt to simplify The Rules:

* Your Company must be founded in Ireland
* Your Company must target Financial Services exclusively
* Your Company must implement a technology solution
* Your Product must be generally available to the market

Who decides if your Company meets these criteria?

Thanks to everyone who suggested improvements, or sent new companies my way. This map wouldn’t exist if not for the help and support of the Fintech community (i.e. You!).

As always, if you spot any errors, or have a suggestion of a company that should be included (or excluded!) please drop me a mail: kimjongil@gingertechie.com

Merry Christmas everyone :)
